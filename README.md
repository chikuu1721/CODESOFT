Task 1 Completed A simple To-Do List application using the Tkinter library.
It defines a TodoList class with methods to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are stored in a list and saved to a file. The GUI includes entry fields, buttons, and listbox to manage tasks. It loads tasks from a file on startup and updates the GUI.When run, it initializes the Tkinter window and starts the main event loop.

Task 2 Completed Simple calculator using python.
The code begins by displaying a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for the user to choose from. It then prompts the user to input their choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) and two numbers for the calculation. Based on the user's choice, the code executes the arithmetic operation using functions defined for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It performs error checking for division by zero. Finally, it displays the result of the calculation to the user.
